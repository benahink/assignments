                <h3>Tesla Upgrades Model S, Model X Cars, Brings Back Cheaper Variants</h3>
                <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2018-tesla-model-x-p100d-114-1533572879.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=800:*" class="tesla">
                <P class="p1">
                        Tesla Inc, struggling with delay in delivery of its higher-priced Model S and X luxury cars, said on Tuesday it will bring back lower-priced options for those cars and roll out upgrades to improve their driving range and re-charging speed. <br> <br>
                        The company, striving to improve margins and post a profit later this year, has laid off workers including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs. <br> <br>       
                        Tesla has since said it will keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models. <br> <br>
                        The upgrades include a new drivetrain design and a new adaptive suspension system, increasing each vehicle's driving range, the company said in a blog post ahead of its first-quarter results on Wednesday. <br> <br>
                        With the upgrades, the long-range version of Model S and X can now travel 370 miles (595.5 km) and 325 miles, respectively, on the US Environmental Protection Agency cycle. <br><br>
                        The lower-priced options, or the 'standard range' versions, of Model X and Model S were available for purchase on Tesla's website after Tuesday's announcement for $83,000 and $78,000 (roughly Rs. 58 lakhs and Rs. 55.5 lakhs), respectively. Estimated delivery of both cars was set for May. <br><br>
                        Earlier in April, Tesla reported fewer-than-expected vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, with figures for the Model S sedans and Model X SUVs more-than-halving compared with the preceding quarter. <br><br>
                        The Silicon Valley carmaker has faced a range of challenges over the past year as one of the leaders in electric vehicle technology sought to ramp up production, deliveries and sales of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial to its long-term profitability. <br><br>

                <h2>Samsung Galaxy Fold Delay a Crucial Test for the Company, Analysts Warn</h2>
                <P class="p2">
                        South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics is "facing its biggest test ever", analysts said Tuesday after it delayed the release of its $2,000 foldable phone over screen problems. <br><br>
                        The move by the world's biggest smartphone maker -- announced after reviewers provided with early devices reported screens breaking within days of use -- comes less than three years after its Galaxy Note 7 disaster. <br><br>
                        The company said the Samsung Galaxy Fold, which had been due for its US release on Friday, "needs further improvements" before customers can receive it and a new release date will be announced in the coming weeks. <br><br>

                <h2>Amazon to Confirm Closing Its Online Marketplace in China</h2>
                <P class="p2">
                        Retail giant Amazon will withdraw its domestic e-commerce marketplace business in China, effective July 18. <br><br>
                        Facing stiff competition from local online marketplace operators, Amazon's exit from e-commerce business would be the end of the company's 15 years of journey into the China market.

                <h2>Facebook Announces Its First Browser API for Chrome, Aimed at Speeding Up Experience</h2>
                <P class="p3">
                    Social networking giant Facebook has announced its first major API contribution to Googles Chrome browser that is focused on making user experience smoother and faster shortening the time between a click or keystroke and the browser reacting to that. <br><br>
                    In computer programming, API is a set of functions and procedures that supports the creation of applications which later access features or data that is part of an operating system (OS), application or other service. <br><br>
                    "We are excited to share that the 'Chrome 74' release will include the origin trial for our 'isInputPending' API. We hope to take developer feedback from this trial and use it to make the case for fully shipping the API," Nate Schloss and Andrew Comminos, software engineers at Facebook wrote in a blog post on Monday. <br><br>
                    This process of bringing its own API to the Chrome browser marks the new method of developing web standards at the company. <br><br>
                    According to the post, Facebook's "isInputPending" API is now part of a larger effort to build scheduling primitives into the web. <br><br>
                    The social networking giant would make trial of its new API on Chrome available for developers who "are looking to get rid of queuing delays and improve interaction and loading performance". <br> <br>
                    "We hope to continue driving new APIs and to ramp up our contributions to open source web browsers," Schloss and Comminos said.
