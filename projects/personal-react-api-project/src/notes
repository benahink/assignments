1. What are you building? Who is it for?

    My app idea is to create a recipes app that allows users to search and save recipes, 
    create a favorites list, or a frequently used recipes list. I'd like the app to allow users to add their own 
    recipes to share with friends and family, or the app community. 
    The app will have a basic search bar that will search by the recipe name or by ingredients in the
    recipe. I'm not sure if I'd like to add a feature where the user can edit the current recipe and 
    customize it to their liking, and have that saved to their profile.    

2. What are the components you need to make the app work?

    (omit this for now)-app needs a login or register page 
    (omit this for now)-users needs a my profile page (Maybe a welcome message)
    -app needs a top recipes page (Home page)
    -app needs a search bar          
    -app needs a results page (title, image, link to the recipe)
    -recipes need a title
    -recipes need an image
    -recipes need a description
    -recipes need ingredients
    (omit this for now)-users need a save recipes button to my profile
    (omit this for now)-users need a logout button

3. Users Stories: 

    -As a user, I want to save recipes
    -As a user, I want easy to use navigation
    (omit this for now)-As a cook, I want to be able to edit recipes and save to my profile
    (omit this for now)-As a cook, I want to be able to upload recipes
    (omit this for now)-As a cook, I want to be able to share uploaded recipes
    -As a user, I can categorize saved recipes (create folders)
    (omit this for now)-As a user, I want to share recipes with others (links)
